A (rebooted) GUI for creating patches with xdelta3. Now uses xdelta3 3.1.0 with some added features.

Changelog includes:
v2.0
--------
• Updated to use xdelta3 3.1.0 release.  
• Enabled secondary and higher source window size (results in smaller patch files).  
• Added xdelta3 arguments line for finer control.  
• GUI now creates a empty changelog file (2.Changelog.txt) as well as patching instructions (1.Readme.txt).  
• Colour co-ordinated list boxes.  
• Updated Folder browser to full featured version for Patch File Destination setting.  
• Set GUI to copy xdelta3 to patch sub directory by default.  
• Set default subdirectory to vcdiff as default for patch files.  
• Set patch files to have Old files file name.  
• Set new extension for patch files to .vcdiff.  
• Updated copyright date and version information.  
• Created custom logo.  
• Updated Makepatch.bat section accordingly.  
• Added confirmation box after patch creation.  
• Run patch application in verbose mode.  

To Add
---------
• Add a new option where one could specify what patch extension they would like.  
• xdelta3 source wildcard (so that any new version of xdelta can be placed in the root folder).  
• Drag and drop functionality.  
• Make gui draggable while patch making is running.  
• Only have one instance of a cmd window when making a batch patch.  
• Change icon in menu bar.   
• Add @pause to patch making cmd and .bat application cmd.  
• Fix .zip creation (creates an empty dir)
